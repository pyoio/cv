<div class="summary">
    <p>Experienced backend and principal software engineer. Expertise in JVM languages, Automation, and DevOps, particularly in systems running under AWS. Deeply passionate about Agile, XP, DevOps and automation, enabling teams to deliver quickly and safely, providing a tight feedback loop to allow demonstration of value and fast iteration.</p>

    <p>Current role involves leading development of a product to support the real-time ingest, analytics and display of high granularity energy consumption data from thousands of distributed devices, to customers and the rest of the business.</p>

    <p>Beyond my team and product, I lead efforts to help teams effectively and quickly deliver cloud based architectures (applying DevOps principles), educated teams on the use of container technologies. I was involved in the bootstrapping and proof of concept work around an internal data lake project, allowing multiple teams to easily stream their data and make it available for insight throughout the business, reducing turnaround times and increasing flexibility.</p>
        
    <p>I also led the creation of a squad across multiple teams to address cross-cutting concerns with the overall customer experience, leading to the identification of issues that didn’t fit within any single team’s remit, resulting in the creation of a team whose remit was holistic oversight of the customer experience, and improved feedback from customers.</p>

    <p>My background has always been in distributed systems, initially in making them fault tolerance/resilient, leading me towards DevOps and making use of containers, cloud computing, and automation at all levels. My functional programming is mostly done in Scala (Java and JavaScript in previous roles), more recently I have begun learning Haskell in my personal time to better underpin FP concepts and type-level programming, and I’m very keen to use it in production and learn more.</p>

    <p>Academic background: PhD in application of cryptographic protocols to asynchronous message based interactions to transparently provide guaranteed fairness and accountability to exchanges. Followed by a postdoctoral research associate role consulting with various groups around the university and in industry to provide consultation and development of scientific workload processing systems.</p>
