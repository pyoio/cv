<div class="summary">
    <p>Experienced backend and principal polyglot software engineer with a soft spot for functional languages and expertise in JVM languages. Deeply passionate about Agile, XP, DevOps (and its automation), enabling teams to deliver quickly and safely, providing a tight feedback loop to allow fast demonstration of value and iteration.</p>

    <p>My niche is SRE/DevOps where we're enabled to do first-class software engineering, and empathise with the users we're trying to help.</p>

    <p>Vocal proponent of equality and diversity, you'll find me involved in all LGBTQ* efforts/groups, and trying to use my voice to ensure a variety of backgrounds are represented in any conversation.</p>

    <p>Current role involves development of all aspects of the internal platform as a service, provided to the rest of tech. The platform uses AWS and DataDog to provide an opinionated containerised pipeline from dev-to-prod with minimal friction. Most recently I have lead efforts to enable seamless multi-region active-active deployment of applications, and work to ease the scaling out of the platform into multiple AWS accounts. Previous roles can be found in detail below.</p>

    <p>My interest has always been in distributed systems, particularly making them resilient, leading me towards DevOps, containers, cloud computing, and automation at all levels. My functional programming is mostly done in Scala (Java and JavaScript in previous roles), more recently I have begun learning Haskell in my personal time to better underpin FP concepts and type-level programming, and Iâ€™m very keen to use it in production and learn more.</p>

    <p>Academic background: PhD in application of cryptographic protocols to asynchronous message based interactions to transparently provide guaranteed fairness and accountability to exchanges. Followed by a post-doctoral research associate role consulting with various groups around the university and in industry to provide consultation and development of scientific workload processing systems.</p>
