                <p>My PhD was titled 'Middleware to Support Accountability of Business to Business Interactions' and focussed on the application of protocols designed to provide 'fairness' and 'accountability' to message based interactions (primarily over message oriented middleware).</p>

                <p>The PhD was jointly sponsored/funded by EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) and RedHat technologies.</p>

                <p>The work involved a study of technical standards relating to messaging (JMS, AMQP, Amazon SQS/SNS), business-to-business messaging and conversations (e.g., OASIS ebXML, RosettaNet) and ways in which protocols providing fairness and/or accountability (e.g., fair exchange, non-repudiation) could be applied in systems built on these technologies.</p>

                <p>A specific technical focus of this work was how to add these extra guarantees without compromising on transparency and compatibility.</p>

                <p>The latter half of the project incorporated RESTful and cloud based technologies into solutions with a view to how adding features transparently could be used to provide augmented Platform as a Service offerings.</p>

                <p>Technologies used: Java, Java EE, Scala, Amazon AWS, AMQP, Linux, OSX.</p>
