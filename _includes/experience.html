            <p>Working under the Content Discovery as part of the BBC Online Search team, providing APIs and UIs for searching content produced across the entire BBC. The APIs and UIs supported every domestic BBC site/sub-site, iPlayer Video/Radio and newer mobile apps.</p>

            <h5>Projects</h5>
            <ul class="project-list">
                <li>Architected and implemented year-long migration from commercial search-engine, hosted in-house, to open source (Solr) hosted in AWS with zero downtime or change in functionality to consumers across the entire business.</li>
                <li>Re-architected, designed and implemented new search, suggestion and recommendation UI to become part of the site-wide BBC header, establishing new team norms for frontend development using React.</li>
                <li>Trained with AWS to become a self-reliant DevOps team, owning and operating the newly migrated Search systems.

                <li>Architected and implemented a serverless pipeline for ingesting documents from any team in the BBC to be indexed in the new search system. Kept existing API contracts in place but completely re-architected everything underneath, giving us the flexibility to add new sources/destinations for indexed content, and practically unlimited scalability for bursty workloads.</li>
                <li>As a 10% R&amp;D project, collaborated to create a "toolshed" project which used Docker/ECS to allow our team (and other teams in the same group) to rapidly deploy prototypes, proof-of-concepts or short-lived systems without the need to do heavyweight deployment of servers as had previously been the norm.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with other teams in the group to develop an internal python framework to interface onto the BBC's federated cloud APIs to allow us to enable Continuous Deployment all the way to Prod from our Jenkins pipelines.</li>
